# Note 1 : This repository is based on the NLP courses I took from Cousera and Udacity.  The Codes are orginally In Numpy and I replace this repository replaces some Numpy code with Pytorch Code.
# Note 2 :  I did not include some projects here because they are in the proces of translation from Numpy to Pytorch. The list of projects I  did not include is as follows
- Word Auto Correct System using Neural Networks.
- Auto Complete System Using Neural Networks.
- Predicting Countries From Capitals.
- Duplicate Question Prediction using Siamese Networks .
- Part of Speech Tagging using  Deep Neural Networks.
- Duplicate Question Prediction using Siamese Networks .
- Implementing Logistics Regression From Scratch using Numpy For classification.
- Implementing a Deep Neural Network From Scratch using Numpy For Regresion.

# Note3 :Except for Named Entity recongntion, ignore the error you see in the juoyter notebook. All the other codes are running fine with good acurac
